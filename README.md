NOTE: In the repo when you look at it, the files you will want to look at are logistic_regression_feature_engineering.ipynb and linear_regression.ipynb. logistic_regression.ipynb is interesting but I didn't end up using it in the report or my presentation because it was getting to a lot of work and I didn't have that much time.
